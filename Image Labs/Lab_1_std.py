@TODO:
Requirement #1 
-Read and print image 'coffee'  
-Show and print half of the  image
-----hint :use the attribute shape of numpy to get the image object dimentions

@TODO:
Requirement #2 
RGB to gray and HSV:
1- Write a function 'gray_image' that takes an image as input , then
    -get the gray scale of the image, then
    -display original image and the gray scale one side by side (subplot).
    -hint: use rgb2gray to get the graylevel of the image
- test your function with the image 'pyramids'
    
2- Write a function 'HSV_image' that takes an image as input , then
   -show the RGB image and the (3 channels of HSV image each channel in separated form ) one side by side (subplot).
   -hint: -use rgb2hsv (to get the hsv representation of the image).
          -To separately get the Hue, Saturation and Value channels, use hsvImg[:,:,X], 
           where hsvImg is the hsv representation of the image. 
           Hue is the first channel, Saturation is the second and value is the last channel.
- test your function for the images in HSV Folder. And comment on the results.

Requirement 2 (Noise):
http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.util.html#skimage.util.random_noise

1.For an image of your choice (the effect of noise must be obvious): 
    Read the image.
    Convert it to greyscale.
    Apply salt & pepper noise with 
    amount=0.05, 0.5 and 0.9
   
2. From the other images. Recommend one image that wonâ€™t be greatly affected by the noise and state why.

Requirement 3 (Histogram):

1- For the given images ( in histogram folder): 
    Read the image.
    Apply histogram and show it.
Hint
    A) Use histogram (image) to get histogram. Try different values for nbins (256,64,8), What does it mean?
    B) and function(showHist) to draw it.
** 2- Draw a grey-scale image that has uniform histogram 
same number of pixels for all intensity levels) using code only. Let the size of the image be 256x256.
use np.ones to draw image with ones.
